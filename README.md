60 Days of Java
==================

A Private Programming Boot-Camp
---

**Concept**:   
During a 60 day period, work your way through a list of projects in a programming language of your choice. Create at least one GitHub commit per day.

The idea is to get a lot of code exposure in a structured way during a relatively short amount of time and come out of the experience with something to show for it much like the programming boot-camps that have recently been popping up in various countries (mainly USA though).  
When possible, use Test-Driven Development and some form of code review (IRC, StackOverflow, StackExchange).

**Planning**:  
Time frame will be 01.06.2014 - 31.07.2014.  

A sensible goal might be 3 days per project:  
  * Day 1: Conceptual design  
  * Day 2: Most of the coding  
  * Day 3: Refactorization and Documentation  
  
With one additional day as buffer the outcome should be around 15 projects.

**Preliminary list of Projects**:
  * Many small karan/Projects exercises
  * FTP browser?
  * Image gallery with thumbnail and upload functionality
  * Web browser?
  * Music/Video player?
  * SQL Query analyzer?
  * Report generator, markdown, html?
  * IMDB Browser  
  * Chess/Sudoku  
  * TV Show Tracker (webapp?)  
  * To-Do-List (webapp?)  
  * PDF-Generator/Name-Scrambler
